                It is <b>MaxCinema Media’s</b> policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the website.
                <br><br>

                We have adopted this privacy policy to explain what information may be collected on our website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
                <br><br>

                This Privacy Policy, together with the <b>Terms and Conditions</b> posted on our website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our website.

                <b>Website Visitors</b> <br><br>
                Like most website operators, <b>MaxCinema Media</b> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
                <br><br>

                <b>MaxCinema Media’s</b> purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MaxCinema Media’s visitors use its website.
                <br><br>

                From time to time, MaxCinema Media may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                <br><br>

                MaxCinema Media also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.maxcinema.com blog posts.
                <br><br>

                MaxCinema Media only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. <br><br>
